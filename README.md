Mock-up Social Media page, made with HTML, CSS and JS.. If I actually used a database outside of bare-boned JS, maybe I could extend it further, but for what it is, and in the first week of working with JavaScript, I am proud of this.


I must add that the Create Account and Sign-In page are not connected, haven't figured that out yet, however you can see that they DO save on the specific page that you are on, until you refresh or go back. There are a few pre-set accounts that you can "sign-in" with. For example, use "User1" and "Password1" to sign-in.
If you try to create an account with the username "User1", "User2" and "User3", you will not be able to, which is good because they are in the databse object, so you cannot create an account if it's already part of that array.

The CSS isn't amazing, I was mainly focusing on the Javascript!
